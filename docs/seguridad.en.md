# Security and Data Protection 🔒

Your trust is the most important thing.  
That’s why RespirApp is built with secure technologies and strict rules to protect your messages and contacts.

---

## 🔑 Authentication
We use **Supabase Auth** for your login.  
👉 This means only you can access your account — no weak passwords or shared access.

---

## ☁️ Cloud storage
Your audios and videos are stored in a secure bucket within **Supabase Storage**.  
👉 Only you have access to them: no one else can see or listen to what you record.

---

## 🛡️ Access rules
- The database is protected: each user only sees their own data.  
- For sensitive operations (such as uploading or deleting a file) we use signed permissions from the API, which prevents unauthorized access.

---

## 🤝 Privacy
You can read all the details in our [Privacy Policy](legal/privacidad.md).  
👉 In short: your data is yours. We only provide the tool to access it securely.

✨ At RespirApp we believe that calm begins with trust.  
Your messages and contacts are always protected.
